        <h1> Miami Heat (2010-2014) </h1> 
        <p>LeBron's decision to leave Cleveland left a very bad taste in everyone's mouths, mainly because he revealed it during a TV Special called "The Decision." Jerseys were burned, Cleveland's owner Dan Gilbert penned inoffensive letter, and the landscape of the NBA changed forever as LeBron had created an even better "superteam." The Miami Heat were vilified for coming off as cocky and they underachieved, winning 2 of 4 finals trips. Not only did LeBron's individual stats take a hit, but he also had a very underwhelming first Finals appearance with the Heat, leading to immense criticism. After that failure, LeBron came into his own as a leader and became an even better player for it.</p>
